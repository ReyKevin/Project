# Data Structure

This project was created as a requirement to fulfill Data Structure's final project in the 2nd semester and written in C language. It was done by my team, consists of Moes, Yodhatama, and I. For this project we decided to try implementing the application of binary search tree for data storing. The program will be able to store the inputted data, edit the stored data, and delete the stored data. The program could also display the stored data, in which the data will be sorted in inorder/preorder/postorder form first before displaying it.
